#Cura Exporter

The goal of this program is that it allows you to easily export large amounts of files at once, and with CuraImporter.exe, can get
those files to any computer. This document will show you the details of how to use this program properly, and presenting important
details to notice.


Notes:
-Cura itself cannot import files exported by this program, that is what the CuraImporter.exe is for
-If you have a Cura_directory file in this folder, do not modify it for safety. If you have changed Cura versions or if you have
 	changed the Cura location, please delete the file and you can input the new information when you next run one of the three
	programs
-Changing options by pressing "Back" is always an option, so there is no need to exit out of the program if you inputted something 
	wrong.

INSTRUCTIONS

1. Run CuraExporter.exe

2. Copy and paste directory

   This window will ask you to put the directory of the Cura software that you use. In order to get this information:

	-Open up Cura
	-Click on the "help" tab on the top left of the screen
	-Click on "show configuration folder"

	-The directory of your Cura files is in the bar in the upper right area. Click on it, and copy and paste it into the entry
		(eg. C:\Users\Students\AppData\Roaming\cura\3.6)
	-A Cura_Directory file should appear in the folder, this is for the program to easily access the directory without needing
		to ask every time the program is run. Deleting this file will only make you input the information once again.

3. Export Material or profile settings?

	-Check of whether you want to export materials, profiles or both.

4. Select which profile you would like to export (if you did not click on the "profile" option in the previous window, you will not
	see this window)

	-Check off all of the profiles you want to export
	-The entries beside each of the check boxes are there if you want to rename a profile. Checking off a profile and inputting
		a name in the entry directly to the right of it will, when imported, change the name of the profile
	-Any entry whose check box has not been selected will be ignored

5. Select which materials you would like to export (if you did not click on the "materials" option in window 4, you will not see this
	window)

	-The same instructions apply as above, in window 4

6. Please input the directory where you want to export

	-If you have a USB or a specific directory, such as a location on a sever, which you want to export these files to, input
		the directory here. (eg. N:\Co-op Students)
	-Inputting nothing into the entry will create a file in the Cura-Tools folder, where this is.

The exported file will be named "EXPORTED CuraFiles #N", where N changes so that the folders do not have the same name. You may 
change the name of this folder if needed, as in CuraImporter.exe you will be prompted to input the name of this folder.
